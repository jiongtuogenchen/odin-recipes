    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 pound pork rib tips</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) bottle BBQ sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix together brown sugar, chili powder, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a large bowl
            until combined. Add rib tips and mix until ribs are thoroughly coated. Let rest at room temperature for 10
            minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Place coated ribs in a slow cooker. Stir together 3/4 of the BBQ sauce with liquid smoke in a medium bowl
            until well combined. Pour evenly over ribs. Cook on Low until ribs are tender, 4 to 6 hours. Set an oven
            rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking tray or broiler rack
            with aluminum foil.

        </li>
        <li>Remove ribs to the prepared tray and baste with remaining BBQ sauce.

        </li>
        <li>Cook ribs under the preheated broiler until sauce is hot and sticky, 3 to 5 minutes per side.

        </li>
    </ol>
